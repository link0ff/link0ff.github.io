While browsing the Adobe Firefly gallery of AI-generated images at the
beginning of 2023 when the LLM craze started, one image caught my eye.
It was a baby robot walking in the rain.
This image possesses deep symbolism.

First, it depicts AI not as something emotionless and therefore frightening
that should be feared.  On the contrary, AI in this form even evokes sympathy.

in numerous films.  But at least so far, the models remain under control.

Secondly, despite the fact that water poses a danger to metallic beings
susceptible to rusting, the robot fearlessly steps through puddles.

But the first image was quite rough, so I started to try generating
more similar images using other available models.  Here is a sequence
that shows the progress.
