title: 2024-08 DALL-E

Then after the initial image, for a long time, I couldn’t
find a model that came close to the quality of this image.

For example, this robot generated by DALL-E in 2024 was more like
[Teletubbies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletubbies):

Another attempt produced a robot like EVE from the film
[WALL-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E)
or like [ASIMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIMO):

Then asked to generate a robot more like from the film
[Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_(2005_film)),
but the result was too bleak.

And both Gemini and Grok produced even much worse images, but I even
don't want to show here.  This wasn’t progress but rather regress.
