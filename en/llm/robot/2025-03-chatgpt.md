title: 2025-03 ChatGPT
---
Only when ChatGPT replaced DALL-E with GPT-4o,
I first asked it to generate a prompt based
on the uploaded original image:

> Write a prompt that will instruct an AI image generator to produce a similar image.

Then it returned such prompt:

> Create an image of a small, charming red robot with large round green
eyes and pink headphones splashing through a puddle during rainfall.
The robot has a shiny circular blue light on its chest and tiny hands.
It's walking with one foot splashing in water, creating splash effects.
The background is a blurred green landscape with rain droplets falling.
The scene has a dreamy, magical quality with a shallow depth of field.
Lighting should highlight the water splashes and raindrops, giving the
image a whimsical, cinematic feel.  Digital art style with vibrant colors
and soft focus.

that allowed the new model to finally generate a decent image:

Isn’t it just adorable?

BTW, a fun fact: when asked ChatGPT to generate a script
for processing songs, as an example of a song title it proposed
[Paranoid Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_Android)
by Radiohead.  This means it’s their favorite song.
